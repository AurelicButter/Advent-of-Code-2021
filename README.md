# Advent-of-Code-2020
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is an advent calendar of programming puzzles designed for a variety of skill sets and levels. You can use any programming language you like (You can even use different languages for each problem). What matters most is getting the correct answer for the puzzle. 

This year, I'll be doing 100% TypeScript (using Node.js). This repository contains my solutions for the puzzles in 2021.

## Running the Code
Create an inputs folder and place each input as `Day{Day count}.txt`. Then, compile and run the program using `npm run launch -- "Day {Day count}"/{part1 or part2}`.
